Payload Obfuscation & Signature Evasion Framework
================================================

Objective
---------
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how encoding and
string obfuscation techniques can be used to evade simple
signature-based malware detection systems.

Test Environment
----------------
Tool: Custom Python-based Payload Obfuscation Framework
Detection Method: Static signature (keyword) scanning

Test Payload
------------
powershell download malware

Techniques Tested
-----------------
1. Base64 Encoding
2. XOR Encoding
3. ROT13 Encoding
4. Random Noise Insertion
5. String Splitting & Rejoining
6. Hex Escape Obfuscation

Results
-------
Original Payload            : DETECTED
Base64 Encoded Payload      : BYPASSED
XOR Encoded Payload         : BYPASSED
ROT13 Encoded Payload       : BYPASSED
Noise Obfuscated Payload   : BYPASSED
Split & Join Obfuscation    : BYPASSED
Hex Escaped Payload         : BYPASSED

Analysis
--------
The original payload was easily detected because it contained
clear-text malicious keywords. After applying encoding and
obfuscation, the same payload no longer matched the static
signatures, allowing it to bypass detection.

Conclusion
----------
This experiment shows that basic signature-based detection
is not sufficient against modern attackers who routinely
use encoding and obfuscation. Security systems must use
behavioral analysis, heuristics, and layered defenses to
detect such threats effectively.
